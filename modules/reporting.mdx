## Configure Reports

Learn how to configure Report Bot's report system to fit your community.

### Report Log Channel
The Report Log Channel is used as a channel where every report made will be logged. The report log channel sends the report log panel which includes moderation actions. We suggest you make your report channel private and only viewable by moderators.

You can configure this by using the `/config reports` command, pressing the dropdown menu, and selecting `Report Log Channel`
<Warning>
This configuration is required in order to use the report system.
</Warning>
### Action Channel
The Action Log Channel is used as a channel where every action taken on a report will be logged. The action log channel is not a required configuration, though we do encourage you to have one.

You can configure this by using the `/config reports` command, pressing the dropdown menu, and selecting `Action Log Channel`
### Moderator Roles
Moderator Roles are used to check if a user is a moderator and can use the report log embed. The moderator role is supposed to be a role within your server that reviews reports and can take action on users.

You can configure this by using the `/config reports` command, pressing the dropdown menu, and selecting `Moderator Roles`
<Tip>
You can select up to **5** moderator roles. 
</Tip>
### Moderation Buttons
Moderation Buttons are used to take action against reported users. These actions will appear of the report message in the report log. This allows you to configure which buttons you would like to display. The default display is Ban, Kick, Timeout, Warn, and None.

You can configure this by using the `/config reports` command, pressing the dropdown menu, and selecting `Moderation Buttons`
### Mentions
The Mentions config is used to determine if you'd like the "Moderator" role to be pinged upon a new report. In order to use the mention configuration you will need to setup a moderator role. Enabling the mentions config helps ensure your community is safe.

You can configure this by using the `/config reports` command, pressing the dropdown menu, and selecting `Mentions`
<Warning>
You must have [Moderator Roles](#moderator-roles) Configured to use this option.
</Warning>
### Case Updates
The Case Updates config is used to determine if you'd like the Reporter to be updated when an action is taken on their report. Enabling the case update config connects moderators with the community. This is enabled as a default config.

You can configure this by using the `/config reports` command, pressing the dropdown menu, and selecting `Case Updates`
