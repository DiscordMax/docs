Report Bot's report tickets system lets users open dedicated report tickets, allowing them to provide additional proof and information directly to moderators. This creates a private, organized ticket channel where reports can be managed efficiently and securely. A Transcript of your report ticket will be provided to you upon the conclusion of your report.

## Configure Tickets

Learn how to configure Report Bot's report system to fit your community.

### Ticket Channel
The Ticket Channel is used as a channel where the ticket creation embed and button will be posted. We suggest the channel you choose is viewable by all members.

You can configure this by using the `/config tickets` command, pressing the dropdown menu, and selecting `Ticket Channel`
<Warning>
This configuration is required in order to use the report tickets system.
</Warning>

### Ticket Category
The Ticket Category is the category which new tickets will be posted. If this is not configured tickets will *not* be posted in a category.

You can configure this by using the `/config tickets` command, pressing the dropdown menu, and selecting `Ticket Category`
### Moderator Roles
Moderator Roles  are used to check if a user is a moderator and can view ticket channels. The moderator role is supposed to be a role within your server that reviews tickets and can take action on users. This role can also be mentioned upon the creation of a ticket.

You can configure this by using the `/config tickets` command, pressing the dropdown menu, and selecting `Moderator Roles`
<Note>
These Moderator Roles are seperate from the [Report System Moderator Roles](/modules/reporting#moderator-roles) 
</Note>
### Mentions
The Mentions config is used to determine if you'd like the "Moderator" role to be pinged upon a new ticket. In order to use the mention configuration you will need to setup a moderator role. Enabling the mentions config helps ensure your community is safe.

You can configure this by using the `/config tickets` command, pressing the dropdown menu, and selecting `Mentions`
<Warning>
You must have [Moderator Roles](#moderator-roles) Configured to use this option.
</Warning>
