Report Bot includes essential moderation commands like ban, kick, timeout, and warn to help keep your Discord community safe and well-regulated. These commands give moderators the power to manage disruptive behavior, enforce server rules, and maintain a positive environment efficientlyâ€”all through Report Bot.
<Note>
These Moderator Roles are the same as the [Report System Moderator Roles](/modules/reporting#moderator-roles)
</Note>
# Ban
The `/ban` command on Report Bot allows moderators to permanently remove a user from the server, with an optional reason. This helps keep your community safe by swiftly addressing severe rule violations.

Get started banning members using the `/ban` command
| Options | Required | Description                     |
| --------|----------| ------------------------------------- |
|`user`|Yes       |User you want to ban, can be a User ID or mention.|
|`reason`|No       |Reason for banning the user.|
# Kick
The `/kick` command on Report Bot allows moderators to remove a user from the server temporarily, with an optional reason. This is useful for addressing disruptive behavior without a permanent ban.

|`reason`|No       |Reason for kicking the user.|
# Timeout
The `/timeout` command on Report Bot allows moderators to temporarily restrict a user's ability to interact in the server for a specified duration. This is ideal for managing minor rule infractions and giving users time to cool down.

Get started timing out members using the `/timeout` command
| Options | Required | Description                     |

# Warn

Get started warning members using the `/warn` command
| Options | Required | Description                     |
| --------|----------| ------------------------------------- |
